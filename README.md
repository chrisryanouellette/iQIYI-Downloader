# iQIYI Downloader

This html file provides all the snippets needed to download an iQIYI video. It does not download the video for you.

# Requirements

- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and working in your terminal.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), only because I am lazy and have not setup a build script for releases.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), only because I am lazy and have not setup a build script for releases.

# Usage

Someday I should make it so the release has the built HTML file... Maybe someday.

1. Clone the repo.
1. Yarn install the packages.
1. Yarn build.
1. Open the `/dist/index.html` file in the browser of your choice.
1. Follow the steps!
